                <H1>Cost to fix an AC leak</H1>
                If it turns out that the system is leaking in one place, it is necessary to replace the component that
                is leaking. Unfortunately, almost any component of the AC might leak.
                <br><br><br>
                If the compressor runs with a low amount of refrigerant for an extended period, it will eventually break
                and you will require a new compressor. <br><br><br>

                If the O-rings are leaking, which could be the case if the car is newer, they will need to be replaced.
                O-rings are a relatively small and cheap component but because the whole system has to be depressurized
                and evacuated, the labor cost will be high. <br><br><br>

                A pack of O-rings will cost on average around LKR.4000.00, while a compressor might go for several hundred
                dollars. The labor cost will vary depending on the part that has to be fixed. <br><br><br>

                <H1>Cost To Fix An AC Compressor</H1>
                As mentioned earlier, for any type of AC repair, the system has to be handled properly, which means
                special tools and a relatively high labor cost will be parts of the repair equation. <br><br><br>

                As with any type of car repair, the labor cost, as well as parts, will depend on your car model. On
                average a new AC compressor costs LKR.35000 to LKR.60000.00 while the labor cost fluctuates between LKR.100000.00 to LKR.300000.00
                depending on the specific car. <br><br><br>

                <H1>Cost To Fix A Clogged Filter</H1>
                Fortunately, this is not an expensive fix and can be done in a few minutes with little to no expertise.
                <br><br><br>

                A new cabin filter costs around LKR.3000.00 to LKR.7000.00 . Changing the filter is quick and very easy to do. There is a
                high risk that dealerships and shops will overcharge you for replacing the cabin filter.
                <br><br><br>

                Therefore, changing the cabin filter is best done yourself. You can also ask a professional to change
                the filter if your car is in the shop for another issue. Under these circumstances, there is a good
                chance that they will do it for free.
                <br><br><br>

                If the condenser is clogged, simply remove the dirt, leaves, or whatever else may obstruct it. Simple
                and cheap! <br><br><br>
