                <H1>What Does the Check Engine Light Do?</H1>
                The check engine light serves to notify you of any issues with your car’s engine or electrical systems.
                You can think of the check engine light as a way your car “talks” to you to let you know something is
                wrong. <br><br><br>

                The check engine light is controlled by the main control unit, which monitors the engine, transmission,
                and exhaust systems. When the control unit senses something wrong, it flips the check engine light to
                notify you about the problem. <br><br><br>

                The tricky thing about the control engine light is that it is not always obvious what the problem is.
                The light could indicate a small problem like a loose gas cap or it could indicate that your emissions
                system is failing.

                <H1>Cost?</H1>
                The first thing you need to do is diagnose the problem. The check engine light could signify multiple
                problems so you need to figure out what is wrong in the first place. <br><br><br>

                It will cost about LKR.30000.00 on average to take your car to a mechanic and have them diagnose the check
                engine light problem. The typical price range for a diagnosis is between LKR.20000.00 to LKR.30000.00 <br><br><br>
