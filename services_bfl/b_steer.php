                <h3>Shock Absorbers and Struts</h3>
                Shocks and strut repairs can stop your car from pulling in a certain direction while you drive and
                reduce friction. Every vehicle should have its suspension system checked for wear-and-tear after every
                50,000 to 60,000 miles. A set of four shock absorbers averages around LKR.500000.00 but that price may
                increase depending on the type of car you drive.
                <br><br><br>
                There are some do-it-yourself kits out there, but unless you’re experienced with cars and know your way
                around a vehicle’s inner-workings, you could do far more harm than good. <br><br><br>


                <h3>Ball Joint Replacement</H3>
                Ball joints connect your car’s tire and wheel to the suspension system. Replacing one costs about LKR.72000.00,
                but a set of four could run closer to LKR.350000.00 Some vehicles only have front ball joints while others
                have them in the back as well.
                <br><br><br>

                <h3>Spring Replacement</H3>
                Spring repairs will reduce bounce, increase stability and make it easier to drive. Depending on your
                car, the average cost of a coil spring replacement is around LKR.140000.00 The total cost may change based off
                your model, the extent of the repair and how many springs needed fixed or replaced. <br><br><br>

                <h3>Total System</H3>
                When it comes to suspension services, you many need front suspension repairs, rear fixes or an
                all-around overhaul. In extreme cases, a mechanic may suggest replacing the entire system due to
                structural damages. If this is the case, expect to spend at least LKR.500000.00, excluding garage costs for
                labor. <br><br><br>

                <h3>power steering pump repair costpower steering pump repair cost</h3>
                The average cost to repair a power steering pump is somewhere between LKR.70000.00 and LKR.100000.00 <br><br>

                To replace the power steering pump with a new part, it will cost between LKR.100000 and LKR.200000.00 (depending on
                car model and what shop you take it to). <br><br><br>

                <h3>Power Steering Reservoir Tank Replacement Cost</h3>
                power steering reservoir replacement costpower steering reservoir replacement cost
                A power steering reservoir tank leak commonly comes from the cap and hose connector. But sometimes, a
                clog from the filter of the reservoir tank can cause a spill or noise especially while turning. <br><br>

                The average cost to replace a power steering reservoir tank is somewhere between LKR.50000 to LKR.80000 depending
                on the vehicle and how hard it is to access the reservoir.
                <br><br><br>

                <h3>Power Steering Hose Repair Cost</h3>
                If you want a cheaper and temporary alternative to replacing the hose, or if you’re out of town and
                need an emergency repair, you can fix the hose yourself. All you need is to find a local auto parts
                store and purchase a male-to-male brass coupler, 2 hose clamps, and something to cut the hose with.
                <br><br>

                Find the portion of hose which has the leak and cut off the section that’s bad. Insert the coupler
                inside each hose in the spot you cut out the bad hose and tighten each side via a hose clamp. <br><br>

                This temporary solution should cost you less than LKR.3000.00 and allows you to get back on the road. You’ll
                eventually want to completely replace the hose since its condition has deteriorated enough where it will
                likely develop other leaks. <br><br><br>

                <h3>Power Steering Rack and Pinion Repair Cost</h3>
                The average cost to repair a leak on a steering rack and pinion assembly will most likely fall somewhere
                between LKR.150000.00 to LKR.300000.00 This is a lot more expensive than other parts of the power steering system since
                you need to completely overhaul the steering rack and pinion. <br><br><br>
