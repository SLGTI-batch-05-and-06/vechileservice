                <H1>Why Change Your Oil?</H1>
                What you don't want to do is ignore the need for oil and filter changes. If you do that, your oil could
                slowly turn into petroleum sludge, fail to flow through the engine, and cause the engine to fail. That
                could virtually total your automobile. What's more likely is that the oil lubricating your engine will
                lose some of its all-important lubricity and accelerate wear on the engine's internals. Clean, fresh oil
                minimizes friction, avoids wear-accelerating metal-on-metal contact between the mechanical bits spinning
                around inside, and can even help your fuel economy. And even good-running vehicles can burn off slight
                amounts of oil over time. Avoid oil changes long enough, and you may run your oil level dangerously low,
                imperiling the engine.

                <H1>When to Change Your Oil?</H1>
                some automakers recommend 3,000 miles or more between oil changes. Regardless of what the Peppy Lube
                Guys' mechanic and their literature says, it's always wisest to go by the book and trust the automaker.
                Remember, they did engineer your vehicle in the first place, and it's in their interest for the vehicle
                to run as well as possible for as long as possible. After all, their name is on it.<br><br><br>

                <H1>cost?</H1>
                the cost may differ from one service station to another. But, expect to pay anywhere between LKR.5000.00 to LKR.10000.00
                for an engine oil change. That said, the average cost might bump up to LKR.8000.00 to LKR.12000.00 if you go for
                synthetic oil. Trust us, the information over there is a pure gem, and honestly, very helpful. So, do
                spare a few minutes on the link to know more about the average cost for an oil change <br><br><br>
