                <p>For drivers who really love their car, washing is a real ritual.
                    The preparation of clean buckets and cloths, the choice of cleaning products,
                    the adjustment of the water jet,
                    are just a few details that those who are used to washing their car safely enjoy to the fullest.
                    But not everyone has enough time or space to clean their car at home. For these ones,
                    there are car washes that come in many types with specific characteristics for every need.
                    <br><br>
                <h1>How much does a car wash cost?</h1>
                <br> The cost of washing your car is influenced by some factors including the type of car wash,
                the size of the vehicle, the package you go for, and the place you are living. However,
                a basic drive-through car wash costs somewhere between LKR.1800.00 and LKR.4300.00 The price for a premium car wash,
                also known as „the works” is anywhere between LKR.4600.00 and LKR.6400.00 This type of washing also includes tire shine
                and wax. <br><br><br>

                According to Autos.com, a full-service automatic wash would cost LKR.6400.00 to LKR.8000.00, while the price for a basic
                automatic is only $7 to $15. <br><br><br>

                If you choose to wash your car at a self-wash, be prepared to be charged by the minute. In order to
                start, you have to pay LKR.720.00 to LKR1800.00 and add LKR.720.00 to LKR.1000 more for each extra minute. <br><br><br>

                Plan to spend anywhere between LKR.5000.00 and LKR.6000.00 if you want a full-service car wash that includes a
                dusted-down console and a vacuum interior. <br><br><br>
