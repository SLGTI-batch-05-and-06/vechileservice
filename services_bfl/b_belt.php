                <H1>What is the driving belt?</H1>
                The driving belt, also known as the serpentine or accessory belt, is the main engine belt that you see
                when you open up the hood of your car and look near your engine to see what drives the internal
                combustion. These belts are usually identifiable by their ridges that run along one side of the driving
                belt. These ridges are there in purpose, in order to keep grip when the accessories are turning and
                moving with the pulleys.

                </H1>
                whether it is completely broken or just loose. The driving belt replacement cost is usually just between
                LKR.35000.00 and LKR.60000.00 in most cases, with the belt and part itself costing between LKR.10000.00 and LKR.30000.00, while the labor
                costs will be between LKR.25000.00 and LKR.40000.00 total. <br><br><br>

                The labor of the fix is reduced in terms of price since it is usually quite easy to access the driving
                belt in every kind of car. The ease of accessing the driving belt will determine how much the labor
                costs area. Some modern vehicles have a more easily accessible driving belt, while other older cars have
                a difficult to find driving belt and could cause the labor costs to increase to around 2 hours of
                work.<br><br><br>
