                <H1>What Causes Flat Tires?</H1>
                Flat tires can be caused by sharp objects in the road, like nails, screws, knives, broken glass,
                industrial debris, or a stick that has been dislodged from a tree and sticking up at an inconvenient
                angle. Although this may seem like a long shot that your car would drive over one of these items, since
                most of them are so small, it is very difficult to spot on the road before driving over them.
                <br><br><br>

                <H1>Cost?</H1>
                Tire repair costs between LKR.1800.00 and LKR.15000.00 for each tire. For that price, the mechanic will patch up your
                puncture. But, if you have special membership at a tire retailer like Costco, youâ€™ll pay nothing for the
                repair. <br><br><br>


                Tyre replacement can cost LKR.25000.00 to LKR.200000.00+ depending on tyre size, tyre brand and type of vehicle. What is a
                tyre? The tyres on your vehicle are made up of a combination of synthetic and natural rubber, along with
                cords or belts to provide a solid construction to withstand the weight of the vehicle and to protect
                against impacts. <br><br><br>
